# CTRLxT_STUDIOS Omni-Kernel-Prime

A quantum-classical hybrid kernel implementation for modern computing systems.

## Overview

CTRLxT_STUDIOS Omni-Kernel-Prime is a Linux kernel module that provides quantum computing capabilities integrated with classical computing systems. It implements a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that enables seamless interaction between quantum and classical computing resources.

## Features

- Quantum state management and operations
- Quantum error correction
- Quantum-classical interface
- Quantum memory management
- Quantum device driver support
- Multi-architecture support (x86, ARM, RISC-V)
- File system integration
- Networking capabilities
- Memory management
- Hardware abstraction layer

## Requirements

- Linux kernel 5.0 or higher
- GCC 9.0 or higher
- Make
- Kernel headers
- Perl (for code style checking)

## Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ctrlxt_kernel.git
cd ctrlxt_kernel

# Build the kernel module
make

# Install the module
sudo make install

# Run tests
make test
```

## Architecture Support

The kernel supports multiple architectures:

- x86_64
- ARM
- RISC-V

To build for a specific architecture:

```bash
make ARCH=<architecture>
```

## Testing

The kernel includes a test suite that can be run using:

```bash
make test
```

## Code Style

To check code style:

```bash
make checkpatch
```
